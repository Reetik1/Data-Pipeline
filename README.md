# Building an Azure Data Analytics Platform for NYC Payroll Data

##  What This Project Is About
Hey! This is my capstone project from the Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree where I built an analytics platform for NYC payroll data. Basically, I had to take a bunch of messy CSV files with employee salary information and turn them into something useful that both city officials and regular people can understand.
The whole point was to help NYC figure out how they're spending money on salaries and overtime, and make that information available to the public. Pretty cool to work on something that actually matters for transparency in government!

##  The Problem I Was Solving
The City of New York had all this payroll data scattered around in different CSV files from various agencies, and they needed:

A way to see how much they're spending on overtime (apparently it's a lot!)
To understand which departments are costing the most money
To make all this information public so taxpayers can see where their money goes
Better reporting tools instead of manually going through spreadsheets

##  My Solution
I built an end-to-end data pipeline using Azure cloud services. Here's what it does:

Takes raw CSV files from different city agencies
Cleans up the messy data (there was a LOT of cleanup needed)
Combines everything into one clean database
Creates calculated fields like total compensation per employee
Makes it all available through Azure Synapse for analysis

##  Technology Stack

- Data Lake: Azure Data Lake Gen2 (Hierarchical Namespaces)
- Data Warehouse: Azure SQL Database
- ETL/ELT Platform: Azure Data Factory
- Analytics Engine: Azure Synapse Analytics
- Version Control: GitHub Integration
- Monitoring: Azure Data Factory Monitoring

## Data Model
-  Source Data Structure
The platform processes municipal payroll data with the following structure:
Master Data Tables

- AgencyMaster â†’ City agency reference data
- TitleMaster â†’ Job title classifications and pay scales
- EmpMaster â†’ Employee master information and demographics

Transactional Data

- nycpayroll_2020 â†’ Historical payroll transactions for 2020
- nycpayroll_2021 â†’ Current payroll transactions for 2021

Target Analytics Schema

- Aggregated Payroll Data â†’ Consolidated view with calculated fields:

- TotalPaid = RegularGrossPaid + TotalOTPaid + TotalOtherPay

## Project Implementation
